      From his birth in 1918 until 1941, Nelson Mandela lived in the rural Eastern Cape. The son of a Thembu chief (traditional leader), his primary influences as a young person were the customs of the Thembu people and the education he received at Christian mission schools. Between 1939 and 1941 he studied at the University of Fort Hare, a tertiary institution for black South Africans (and black students from other African countries), where he was first exposed to the politics of African nationalism. In 1941 he left the Eastern Cape for the city of Johannesburg, where he was to be exposed more directly to the realities of state racism and where he was to find a political home in the African National Congress.

      For most of his adult life, Mandela has been a diligent maker of records and an obsessive record-keeper. How else to explain his collection of Methodist Church membership cards recording his annual membership between 1929 and 1934.

    <strong>Early Political Career:</strong> Nelson Mandela joined the African National Congress in 1944 and Formed the ANC Youth League. He rose through the ranks of the ANCYL and through his work the ANC adopted in 1949 a more radical policy, the Programme of Action. He was arrested on 5 December 1955 along with 156 other activists and was acquitted on 29 March 1961. The ANC and the Pan African Congress were banned on 8 April 1960 after police killed 69 unarmed protesters, leading to a state of emergency. Nelson Mandela was among thousands detained during this period. In 1962, he left the country secretly to gain support from the rest of Africa and ENgland. On 27 May 1963 he was charged with leaving the country illegally and sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. On 11 June 1964 Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment and sent back to Robben Island.
